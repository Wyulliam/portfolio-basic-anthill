# WORK IN PROGRESS
Before going thru this project, keep in mind that it is in progress. 
This are the main things that are **waiting to be developed**:
- **Use of Entity framework**: the repositories are fake right now
- **Integration Tests**: test the application after Entity Framework
- **Life and death of ants**: after being born, ants are supposed to die after a while

# What is this project?
This is a simple project that is part of my online portfolio. The objective of the portfolio is to pratice and keep track of my designing skills.

This project is an Anthill. Here, you are the Queen of the Anthill and you have the power to lay new eggs of any type of ants. These ants are born, live for a while and die. 
It is a simple console application used to test the code.
